Authentic Grace
----------------

Welcome to our page! This was a collaborative two week project bewtween Cathy Cheo-Isaacs and Jayme Hewitt. This project was meant to teach us how to build a front-end framework from soup to nuts. We collaborated on research, design, and development- working with a business model canvas, wireframes, and github. We used flexbox to help us create part of the layout. We would like to integrate flexbox into the body of the site in the future. We have lots of ideas for V2 and would both like to keep improving on this site.

Thanks for visiting!
Cathy and Jayme

Slideshow
    merged versions. have pictures that JH brought in. I don't think I like auto save because it refreshed the live server.
    pictures are different sizes- need to choose pictures that are the same size/orientation
    Cropped and resized images so they are all the same size
    Adjusted position of prev/next arrows to center vertically on images
    Merged to master to check responsiveness

Testimonials
    probably a similar process to slideshow except automatic
